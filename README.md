Do you run an online business and sell things on your website or social media? If you need a way for people to pay you online, our PHP based solution that uses PayPal is a good choice. It lets you have full control of how people pay you on the internet. PayPal is a well-known way to pay for things online, and it’s used by many people and businesses. It has different services to help with payments. With our solution, you can let people pay on your website or app using PayPal or their credit/debit cards, and they don’t have to give their financial info to you. We use something called APIs to connect with PayPal. Our solution works on the web, and it lets you make payment links for your products. People can use these links to pay you on your website or on social media.

To start, you just need to put in your PayPal email. Our PayPal Clone PHP script has everything you need to manage how you get paid, details about your products, prices, and a record of transactions. You’ll also get emails when someone pays you. When you add a product and a price, you can generate a payment link. You can share this link through email, chat, or on social media. Your customers can use it to pay with their PayPal account or their credit/debit card. This is a simple way to get started with online payments if you want to have an online presence and get paid by people from all over the world. Our PayPal Payment PHP script is built with CodeIgniter PHP and uses a MySQL database. You can change the code to fit your needs after you buy it.
